# NodeProject

This is a small project made with Node.js and Express.
It lets users register, login, and has basic admin features.
I also added protection from spammers and login abuse.

Features

- Register and login with JWT
- Login gets blocked after 3 failed attempts in 24h
- Admin can see and delete users
- Users can update their info
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Uses express-rate-limit for spam protection

two environment variables one for production and one for development


 Create a .env.dev file like this:

NODE_ENV=development  
PORT=8000  
JWTKEY=yourSecret  
MONGODB=yourlocalMongoConnectionString

and a second .env.prod file like this:

NODE_ENV=production  
PORT=8000  
JWTKEY=yourSecret  
MONGODB=yourMongoConnectionString

to start the project in terminal !

npm run dev // development
npm run prod // production

First Users

When the server starts, if there are no users in the database,  
it will create 3 users automatically:

- Regular user: noa@example.com / Password1!
- Business user: eyal@biz.com / Password1!
- Admin user: admin@admin.com / Password1!
